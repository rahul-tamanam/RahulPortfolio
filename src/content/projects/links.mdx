The Loan Approval and Prediction System is a data-driven project developed as part of the Business Analytics with R course (BUAN 6356-002). This project addresses inefficiencies in traditional loan processing by replacing manual evaluations—often subject to delays, biases, and errors—with a robust, machine-learning-driven system.
